Byzantine numerals will be used again to denote the Champ Bowl number.","question":"When will Roman numerals be used again to denote the Super Bowl number?","answers":{"text":["Super Bowl LI.","Super Bowl LI","Super Bowl LI"],"answer_start":[324,324,324]}}

After months of work, Tesla fulfilled the task and inquired about payment. Edison, saying that he was only joking, replied, \"Tesla, you don't understand our American humor.\":64  Instead, Edison offered a US$10 a week raise over Tesla's US$18 per week salary; Tesla refused the offer and immediately resigned.
